## Printing to the Console in Python

```py
print("Hello world!")
```

- `print` function
- `string`: a string of characters
- the `"` shows the beginning and the end of the string of characters

## String manipulation and code intelligence

- Use newline character `\n`
- Combine 2 strings using `+` operator

```py
    print("Hello" + " " + "world!")
```

## The Python input function

```py
    input("What is your name?")
```

- `input` function: allows user to type some text into our program
